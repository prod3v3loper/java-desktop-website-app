# JAVA DESKTOP APPLICATION

![APP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prod3v3loper/java-desktop-website-app/main/src/main/resources/images/p3-app.PNG?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACSRTP633NYHX44TT5I32DZ2ZSMJNPQ "Application")

A simple application that allows you to log in via the database and get to the dashboard. The data can be accessed from your website database but also from elsewhere.

Download it and open it with NetBeans, then just click Run and it will open. You can develop it further and add whatever your application needs.

## DATABASE

Change your database, if you already have a local environment (developer environment) then you can directly use localhost and work and develop with it.

```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:6606/databasename";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "test";
```

# Attention

This one should not use in a real environment but unfortunately there is also something in real environments.
